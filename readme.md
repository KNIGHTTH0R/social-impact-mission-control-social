#Mdump - Social Mediocrity 
tl;dr: Generates a profile of a company's public social interactions, mongo's it, and exposes via the usual json get/post

This was a hack from the Social Impact Hackathon developed during an additional modding day, a component of the larger "Mission Control" v2 dashboard project. (https://github.com/atleastimtrying/missiondump)
##Usage
***
"http://msom.eu01.aws.af.cm/index.php/companies/<company>" -> Returns the data for specified company
"http://msom.eu01.aws.af.cm/index.php/companies/" -> Returns all companies currently stored/"cached" in mongo

If requested company is not in mongo, it will fetch for all fields, build an object, inject into mongo, and return. - This is transparent and does not affect the request (bar a delayed initial response time)

Create a new apiKeys.php before use, apiKeys_sample provides a template.

##Imports
***
- toroweb

##Sample Query
***
http://msom.eu01.aws.af.cm/index.php/companies/amazon

##Status
***
```
- Returns public tweets from company
- Return public self FB posts from company page


- DOES NOT return public "stories" (posts to other users/pages) <- WIP, seperate object?
- DOES escape most text (albeit crudely) so no broken json
- DOES NOT check for nulls, not that there should ever be any.


- Any "Broken" JSON will simply be rejected by Mongo (and discarded)
```
Returns:

```json
