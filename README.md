##Endpoints

##Usage
"http://msom.eu01.aws.af.cm/index.php/companies/<company>" -> returns data for <company> from mongo
"http://msom.eu01.aws.af.cm/index.php/companies/" -> returns all companies from mongo

If company is not in mongo will fetch for all fields, build an object, inject into mongo, return. - This is transparent and does not affect the client (bar query time)

Create a new apiKeys.php, apiKeys_sample.php provides a template.

##Imports
